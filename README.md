# Ludo ðŸŽ²
Embedded Systems 2 Project, based on the Ludo Game ðŸŽ²

# Brief Description:
Ludo is played on a square board with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern, divided into four colored sections. Each player has four tokens that they must navigate from their starting point, around the board, and into their home area. The objective is to be the first to get all four tokens to the home area, overcoming challenges posed by opponents along the way.

# Rules
###Rolling the Dice:
- The first player rolls the dice. The number shown on the dice determines how many steps they can move their token.
- If the player rolls a 6, they get an additional turn. This continues if they keep rolling a 6.
  
###Moving Tokens:
- Players move their tokens according to the number rolled on the dice.
- If a playerâ€™s token lands on a space occupied by an opponentâ€™s token, the opponentâ€™s token is sent back to their starting area, and they must start again from scratch.
  
###Winning the Game:
- The goal is to move all four tokens around the board and into the home area.
- The first player to get all their tokens to the home area wins the game.
