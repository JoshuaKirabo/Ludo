Embedded Systems 2 Project, based on the Ludo Game ðŸŽ²

# Brief Description:
Ludo is played on a square board with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern, divided into four colored sections. Each player has four tokens that they must navigate from their starting point, around the board, and into their home area. The objective is to be the first to get all four tokens to the home area, overcoming challenges posed by opponents along the way.
